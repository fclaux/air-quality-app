# Air Pollution Monitoring Web Application
This project is a web application designed to provide information about air pollution based on the user's location, determined by their IP address. The development of this application is documented in three distinct phases, each stored in a separate folder.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main folders:

1. **Initial Version (folder initial-version):**
    - This version represents my first attempt at developing the application. It reflects my skills and knowledge at this initial stage of the project. The code may contain errors, inefficiencies, and areas in need of improvement.
  
2. **Corrected Version (folder corrected-version):**
    - This folder contains the corrected version of the application, based on feedback and corrections received during my training course. This version incorporates modifications to resolve issues identified in the initial version and improve the structure and performance of the application.

3. **Improved Version (folder improved-version):**
    - This final version represents an enhanced application that merges the best practices and solutions from the previous two versions. It includes optimized features, better code organization, and performance improvements. This folder demonstrates significant progress in my development skills, combining self-learning and the knowledge acquired during my training.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to document and demonstrate the evolution of my development skills through different phases of learning and improvement. By comparing the different versions of the application, one can observe the progress made in terms of code quality, application structure, and performance.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fclaux/air-quality-app.git
cd air-quality-app
```

2. **Navigate to the desired version folder:**

```bash
cd initial_version  # or corrected_version, or improved_version
```
3. **Open the index.html file in your browser:**

You can simply open the index.html file in a web browser to run the application.
